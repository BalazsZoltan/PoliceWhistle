# PoliceWhistle

An LSPDFR flavor mod for a more realistic officer experience.

## Getting Started

Build a solution for the project in your preferred IDE, which will get you a DLL that you can use

### Prerequisites

Plugins you will need to have installed for this one to work. (You might also have to add a reference to the SDKs of these plugins in case the solution isn't buildable)

```
RagePluginHook
LSPDFR
```

### Installing

Installation is quite easy once you have the DLL

```
Copy the DLL located in bin/Debug, called PoliceWhistle.dll to the folder Grand Theft Auto V/plugins/LSPDFR
```

### Versions

Check the different branches for other versions, do note that I can't (and won't) guarantee that older versions will work the newest LSPDFR/RPH version
